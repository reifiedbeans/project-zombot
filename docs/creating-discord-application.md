# Creating a Discord application

Start by going to the [Discord developer portal][developer-portal]. Create a new application by clicking **New Application**. Give it a name like **Project Zombot** and agree to the terms.

Copy the **Application ID** and **Public Key**; you'll put these values into your [bot configuration](configuration-options.md).

Next, go to the **Bot** tab in the sidebar and click **Add Bot** to add a bot user. Click **Reset Token** and copy the token Discord generates; you'll also use this value when configuring the bot.

Now you can continue on with [deploying the bot](deploying-to-server.md).
